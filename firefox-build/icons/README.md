# Icons Placeholder

For now, you can create simple PNG icons or use any icon generator. The required sizes are:
- 16x16 pixels (icon-16.png)
- 48x48 pixels (icon-48.png) 
- 128x128 pixels (icon-128.png)

You can use online tools like:
- favicon.io
- canva.com
- Or any image editor

The icon should represent YouTube gathering/collecting videos, perhaps with a playlist or collection theme.
